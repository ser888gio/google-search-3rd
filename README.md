Search Application with Download Functionality

This is a readme for a JavaScript application that allows users to search for information and download the results in a plain text format.

Features

    Users can enter a search term in a search bar.
    Upon submitting the search form, the application fetches data from a search engine API.
    The retrieved results are displayed on the page with titles, snippets, and links.
    Users can download the displayed search results as a plain text file named "results.txt".

Technologies Used

    HTML: for the structure of the web page
    JavaScript: for handling user interactions and data processing
    DOM API: for manipulating the content of the web page
    Fetch API: for making asynchronous requests to the search engine API
    Express.js (server.js): to set up a simple server (Note: This file seems to be for a potential server-side implementation, not required for the core functionality)

How to Use

    Replace 'INSERT API KEY' in index.js with your actual API key for the search engine you want to use. (e.g., Google Custom Search)
    Replace 'INSERT SEARCH ENIGNE ID' in index.js with your search engine ID.
    (Optional) If you plan to use the server-side implementation (server.js), replace 'PORT NUMBER' with the desired port number for your server. Configure your server accordingly.
    Open the HTML file containing the application code in a web browser.
    Enter your search term in the search bar and submit the form.
    The search results will be displayed on the page.
    Click the "Download" button to download the displayed results as a plain text file.

Notes

    This readme assumes a basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and the DOM API.
    You'll need to obtain an API key and search engine ID from the search engine you want to use (e.g., Google Custom Search).

    The server-side implementation (server.js) is included but commented out. It's a basic example of how you could potentially fetch data from a server and provide it to the client-side application. The core functionality works without a server.
